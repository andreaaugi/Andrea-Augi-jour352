        <h1>The Dark Side of Fast Fashion</h1>
        <h2>The fashion industry is a major driver of environmental degradation.</h2>
        <h3>By Andrea Augi</h3>
        <p>The demand from consumers for stylish yet reasonably priced apparel is driving the fast fashion industry's continued rapid expansion. Intense marketing tactics and the desire for rapid style changes are the main drivers of this growth, which drives ongoing increases in both production and consumption. The environment pays a price for this desire. Cheap clothing production involves unethical activities that are harmful to everyone involved. High carbon emissions, dangerous chemicals, and excessive water use are also part of the practices. Another significant and expanding issue is the disposal of clothing. Textiles and apparel are being dumped in landfills, which may take years to break down. These problems demonstrate the fashion industry's need to adopt more environmentally friendly practices. </p>
        
        <p>The market for the fast fashion industry is expanding.  The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 was the only major setback the industry had seen.  The market dropped by 11.46% as a result of the pandemic.  In the past ten years, the fashion industry has only gone through this one setback.   In 2024, the global clothing market is expected to be worth $1.79 trillion.  The market is anticipated to expand at 2.81% annually between 2024 and 2028.  The size of the global fashion market during the last few years is shown in the following graphic.   </p>

        <p>It has been revealed that 83% of American consumers believe that pricing is the most crucial factor when making clothing purchases. A shopper's decision to buy a piece of apparel is influenced by a wide range of events. The following graphic shows what consumers look for while buying clothing.</p>

        <p>Approximately 92 million tons of textiles are thrown away globally each year. The average consumer in the United States alone discards over 81.5 pounds of clothing each year, contributing to an estimated 11.3 million tons of textile waste. Barely 1% of clothes are recycled yearly. The following graphic shows how long different materials take to break down.</p>

        <p>The fast fashion industry will grow if consumers do not emphasize sustainable shopping practices. By choosing to shop sustainably, individuals can play a crucial role in protecting the environment before it’s too late.</p>
